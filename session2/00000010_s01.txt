CLINICAL HISTORY:  76 year old left handed man with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and pacemaker who presents with a history of acute onset of left-sided weakness and numbness and confusion, pre-op for right CEA.
MEDICATIONS:  Ancef, Heparin.
REASON FOR STUDY:  Confusion.
INTRODUCTION:  Digital video EEG was performed in lab using standard 10-20 electrode placement system with additional anterior temporal and single-lead EKG electrodes.  The patient was recorded in stage I and stage II sleep.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation and hyperventilation were performed.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES:  None.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD:  The record opens to a well-defined posterior dominant rhythm of 9 Hz, which is reactive to eye opening.  There is a normal amount of frontocentral beta.  Sleep is characterized by stage I and stage II.  Activating procedures including photic stimulation present no abnormal discharges. 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES:   Focal slow waves at F8/T4, occurring at 2 to 4 Hz and an amplitude of 20 to 40 microvolts, intermittently. 
SEIZURES:   None.
IMPRESSION:  Abnormal EEG due to: 
Intermittent right anterior temporal focal slow waves.
CLINICAL CORRELATION:  This EEG reveals evidence of focal cerebral dysfunction in the right anterior temporal region, which is nonspecific in regard to etiology.  No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
