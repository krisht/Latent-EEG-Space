INTRODUCTION: 
An EEG was performed using the 10/20 electrode placement system with EKG and anterior temporal electrodes. Only wakefulness was recorded. Photic stimulation was performed. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Keppra and dexamethasone. 
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS: 
None. 
HISTORY: 
A 67-year-old lady coming with a slurred speech, right facial drooping, mild right-sided weakness, and right hand shaking with a past medical history of small cell lung cancer, liver metastasis, hypertension, and high cholesterol. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE RECORD: 
The record showed posterior dominant rhythm at 10 Hz with 20 to 50 microvolts, which was symmetric and reactive to eye opening. A moderate amount of frontocentral beta rhythm was seen at 18 to 25 Hz frequency with 
ABNORMAL DISCHARGES: 
Continuous focal slow waves in F7/T3 at 2 to 3 Hz with 20 to 70 microvolts. 
SEIZURES: 
None 
IMPRESSION: 
Abnormal EEG with focal slow waves in the left anterior temporal lobe with no seizure activities. 
CLINICAL CORRELATION: 
This EEG revealed the evidence of focal cerebral structural dysfunction in the left anterior temporal region, which is consistent with the known tumor. No seizures or epileptiform discharges were seen.
